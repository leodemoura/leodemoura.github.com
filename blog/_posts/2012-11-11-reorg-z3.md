================

Today, we release [Z3 4.3.0](http://z3.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/a6db55d21f22). This release contains many bug fixes, a new build system, and, more importantly, a complete reorganization of the code base. Now, the code is organized in sub-directories under the directory `src`. It is much easier to find the module we are interested in. For example, if we want to read the **nlsat** source code, we just have to go to the directory `src/nlsat`. The new code reorganization also allow us to easily create binaries/libraries that contain only a subset of the components available in [Z3](http://z3.codeplex.com). 

We are also officially switching to a three number naming scheme for version numbers. The plan is to have more frequent releases. 
We skipped version 4.2 because the binary tagged as 4.1.2 was reporting version 4.2. Many thanks to Claude Marche for reporting this problem.

Moreover, we realized that it does not make sense to provide zip files with source code at [codeplex](http://z3.codeplex.com).
Codeplex provides a "Download" button that automatically creates the zip file for any version/branch/commit.
We just have to go to the ["Source Code" tab](http://z3.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/a6db55d21f22#), select the version we want and click "Download".

The `master` branch is the **official branch**. We use the `unstable` branch for work-in-progress that will be included in the next release.
Finally, we re-started to provide [pre-compiled binaries for Windows](http://z3.codeplex.com/releases). The new binary distribution is much simpler, 
it is just a zip file with the binaries, DLLs, and include files. We have a zip file for [32](http://z3.codeplex.com/downloads/get/528588) and [64 bits](http://z3.codeplex.com/downloads/get/528578).

One bad news is that the ML bindings are still not working in this version, but we will fix that in future releases.

# Building Z3

The new build system is based on python. The script `scripts/mk_make.py` creates the Makefile, generates bindings for .Net and Python, DLL definitions, etc.
It can also optionally create an auxiliary Visual Project file for people that cannot live without Visual Studio intellisense. 
The generated Makefiles can be compiled using Visual Studio `nmake` or GNU `make`.
By default, the script `scripts/mk_make.py` generates the Makefile in the subdirectory `build`.

## Building Z3 on Windows

To compile Z3 on a Windows machine, we should open a Visual Studio Command Prompt (All Programs > Microsoft Visual Studio 20xx > Visual Studio Tools), go to the directory where the Z3 source code is located, and type

{% highlight bash %}
python scripts/mk_make.py
cd build
nmake
{% endhighlight bash %}

## Building Z3 on Linux, OSX (and cygwin)

In other platforms, we just have to execute the following commands.

{% highlight bash %}
autoconf
./configure
python scripts/mk_make.py
cd build
make
{% endhighlight bash %}

The example applications can be built using 

{% highlight bash %}
make examples
{% endhighlight bash %}

Z3 can be installed in these platforms using the standard

{% highlight bash %}
sudo make install
{% endhighlight bash %}

The binaries and libraries are installed in the "prefix" specified in the `./configure` script. The default "prefix" is `/usr`.
To uninstall, we just have to execute

{% highlight bash %}
sudo make uninstall
{% endhighlight bash %}

## Custom builds

To list all command line options available in `scripts/mk_make.py`, we just have to execute

{% highlight bash %}
python scripts/mk_make.py --help
{% endhighlight bash %}

For example, the option `--debug` generates a Makefile that builds Z3 in debug mode.
The file `scripts/mk_project.py` defines all existing modules and dependencies between them.
