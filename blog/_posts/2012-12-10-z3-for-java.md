================

[Z3](http://z3.codeplex.com) now provides support for [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_\(programming_language\)). 
The new Java bindings are based on the .Net bindings developed by Christoph Wintersteiger.
They will be included in the next official release. In the meantime, we can already try them using the [`unstable`](http://z3.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/8bfbdf1e680d) branch.
Please try the new Java bindings and [submit problems and bugs](http://z3.codeplex.com/WorkItem/Create).

Here are the instructions to build the Z3 Java bindings.

First, we have to clone the `unstable` branch from [codeplex](http://z3.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/8bfbdf1e680d).

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://git01.codeplex.com/z3 -b unstable
{% endhighlight bash %}

CodePlex requires [git](http://git-scm.com/) 1.7.10 or later to avoid HTTPS cloning errors. If we get a cloning error, we should use the instructions
found [here](http://z3.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Git%20HTTPS%20cloning%20errors).

Next, we have to checkout the `z3-java` tag. This tag "points" to a fairly stable commit in the `unstable` branch.

{% highlight bash %}
cd z3
git checkout z3-java
{% endhighlight bash %}

Next, we generate the Z3 make file with the option `--java`.

{% highlight bash %}
python scripts/mk_make.py --java
{% endhighlight bash %}

Now, we build Z3 and the example applications.

{% highlight bash %}
cd build
make all examples
{% endhighlight bash %}

That is it. Now, we can execute the example located at [`examples/java/JavaExample.java`](http://z3.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/8bfbdf1e680d#examples%2fjava%2fJavaExample.java) using:

* `java -cp com.microsoft.z3.jar;. JavaExample`   (on Windows)

* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. java -cp com.microsoft.z3.jar:. JavaExample` (on Linux and FreeBSD)

* `java -cp com.microsoft.z3.jar:. JavaExample` (on OSX)
