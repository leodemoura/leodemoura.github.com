================

I'm a Principal Researcher in the [RiSE](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/rise) group at [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com). I joined Microsoft in 2006, before that I was a Computer Scientist at [SRI International](http://www.csl.sri.com/). I obtained my PhD at [PUC-Rio](http://www.puc-rio.br) in 2000. My research areas are [automated reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning), [theorem proving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_proving), [decision procedures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_procedure), [SAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) and [SMT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories).
I'm the main architect of [Lean](https://github.com/leodemoura/lean),  [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), [Yices 1.0](http://yices.csl.sri.com/) and
[SAL](http://sal.csl.sri.com). Lean is a new open source theorem prover that [Soonho Kong](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~soonhok) and I are currently developing from scratch.
Z3 and Yices are [SMT solvers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories),
and SAL (the Symbolic Analysis Laboratory) is an open source tool suite that includes symbolic and bounded model checkers, and automatic test generators.
Z3 has been open sourced (under the MIT license) in the beginning of 2015.
I received the [Haifa Verification Conference Award](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/conferences/hvc2010/award.shtml) in 2010.
In 2014, the TACAS conference (Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems) has given an award for
"_The most influential tool paper in the first 20 years of TACAS_" to the Z3 paper: _Z3: An Efficient SMT Solver. 14th International Conference, TACAS 2008, vol. 4963 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science_.
