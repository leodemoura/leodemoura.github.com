================

Leo is a Senior Principal Applied Scientist in the Automated Reasoning Group at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). In his spare time, he dedicates himself to serving as the Chief Architect of the [Lean FRO](http://lean-fro.org), a non-profit organization that he proudly co-founded alongside [Sebastian Ullrich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-ullrich-901b33267/). He is also honored to hold a position on the Board of Directors at the Lean FRO, where he actively contributes to its growth and development. Before joining AWS in 2023, he was a Senior Principal Researcher in the RiSE group at [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com), where he worked for 17 years starting in 2006. Prior to that, he worked as a Computer Scientist at [SRI International](http://www.csl.sri.com/). His research areas are [automated reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning), [theorem proving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_proving), [decision procedures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_procedure), [SAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) and [SMT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories).
He is the main architect of several automated reasoning tools: [Lean](https://lean-lang.org),  [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), [Yices 1.0](http://yices.csl.sri.com/) and
[SAL](http://sal.csl.sri.com). Leo's work in automated reasoning has been acknowledged with a series of prestigious awards, including the [CAV](http://i-cav.org/2021/cav-award/), [Haifa](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/conferences/hvc2010/award.shtml), and [Herbrand](http://www.cadeinc.org/Herbrand-Award) awards, as well as the [Programming Languages Software Award](https://www.sigplan.org/Awards/Software/) by the ACM. Leo's work has also been reported in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/02/science/ai-mathematics-machine-learning.html) and many popular science magazines such as [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-effort-to-build-the-mathematical-library-of-the-future/), [Quanta](https://www.quantamagazine.org/lean-computer-program-confirms-peter-scholze-proof-20210728/), and [Nature News](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00487-2).
